# Reactvitae

Reactvitae is a React template for generating interactive resumes. Its name is a wordplay on "React" and "Curriculum Vitae" (resum√©), which accurately describes the project. With Reactvitae, you can easily create a clean resume that showcases your skills and experience on an interactive page.

## Usage

All the data required by the application is stored in the `src/data/` directory. You can add your information to the relevant files in this directory. Once you have entered your details, running the application will generate a resume that looks like this:
